Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree: Neighborhood Map Project
============================
The requirements for this project are to develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood. It will have this additional functionality:
- map markers to identify popular locations or places Iâ€™d like to visit
- a search function to easily discover these locations
- a listview to support simple browsing of all locations
- a third-party API that provide additional information about each of these locations ( http://www.brewerydb.com/developers)


Usage Instructions
==================

The application shows a Google Map of the University of Minnesota area, with several breweries designated with markers on the map. A search box can be used to filter the list of breweries.

The application can be run directly from the [GitHub Repository](https://rawgit.com/howardjmn/NeighborhoodMap/master/index.html)

You can also run it locally by downloading the repository to a folder on your computer, then opening the index.html file in the web browser of your choice.

## Resources Used For This Project
- Knockout Framework (knockoutjs.com)
-- This implementation is based on the "Cat Clicker" application developed in this course.

- Google Maps API
-- This implementation is based on the examples provided in the "Understanding API services" module in this course.

Update History
 - Iteration 1: Just displays a map and list of locations

 - Iteration 2: Added markers and infowindows, copying code from (Project_Code_4_WindowShoppingPart2.html) with modifications to make it compatible with knockout.

 - Iteration 3: Clicking item in the list now opens the corresponding infoWindow.  This wasn't working in the previous iteration because I had created separate observable arrays for the locations and the markers.  I only needed the one for the markers.  Debugged with help from http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/foreach-binding.html.  Also added marker animation (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/marker-animations-iteration).

- Iteration 4: Added search function, using code from http://www.knockmeout.net/2011/04/utility-functions-in-knockoutjs.html.  Also copied 'stringStartsWith' function from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30168480/ko-utils-stringstartswith-not-working.
